    "Background:\n",
    "----------\n",
    "4875 tweets were randomly generated in mongodb (excluding retweets). Tweets were labeled as Relevant (R or 1) or Non-Relevant (N or 0) by two researchers (Stefan and I). A tweet was considered relevant if it contained words that were suggestive of clinical trialrecruitment and had wording related to illness or disease, gender, or age (e.g. ‚ÄúAre you a teen with Celiac‚Äôs disease? If so, you may eligible to join our #clinicaltrials‚Äù). The final result of this was 163 relevant tweets (1) and 4711 junk tweets (0). Their were 3.26% relevant tweets that Stefan and I agree on. 95.4% of total tweets Stefan and I agree on. The training dataset is called \"merged_clean_tweets.xlsx.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Use supervised machine learning to obtain relevant tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Obtain a final list of the Tweet IDs for relevant tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried various different classifiers (not all shown here), including random forests and SVM. Ultimately, I used KNN because it gave me the best precision score to correctly select relevant tweets."
